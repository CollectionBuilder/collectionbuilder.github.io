## 7. Editing Your Repository

Once you start **customizing your repository**, here are a few things you should know:

1. GitHub Destkop and your text editor (probably VSCode or Atom) are looking at the same folder of files (your repository), so once you save the changes you make to files in your text editor, those changes will show up in the left-hand "Changes" column in GitHub Desktop. 
    - When you're ready to commit the changes you've made, simply navigate to GitHub Desktop and select the checkboxes next to the files you'd like to commit. 
    - Enter your commit message in the box at the bottom of the column, click the blue "Commit to master" button, and push your changes using the button in the top right of the GitHub Desktop window.
2. If you're working on multiple computers or collaborating, be sure to fetch and pull changes before you push new ones. 
    - You can do this by clicking on the button in the top right of the GitHub Desktop interface labeled "**Fetch origin**." 
    - If there is content to pull, once it is fetched this button will say "**Pull origin**." Click on the button to pull the changes, and you will see your local repository change accordingly.
