## 3. Commit Your First File

Open the _config.yml folder in your text editor. Change the "title" variable, and save the change. Now go back to GitHub Desktop to commit that change following the instructions below.

#### Commit to your change!

On GitHub Desktop, below the the column that lists your change to _config.yml, you'll see a text-entry box labeled "Summary (required)." 

- Type a "commit" message into the box -- a short message describing the changes you've made. In this case, you might enter something like "changed title of collection site." 
- When you've finished your commit message, click on the blue button toward the bottom of the column that says "Commit to master."
- The "Changes" disappear, you've just made a Git Commit!

#### Now you need to PUSH!!!

You've committed your changes locally, but haven't pushed them to the online repository yet. 
To push your commit up to GitHub, click on the button at the top right of the GitHub desktop screen that says "Push changes."

- Click "Push changes"
- Navigate to your repository on GitHub web interface (Click CTRL + SHIFT + G in GitHub Desktop). You'll see that the _config.yml file has been updated with the new changes.
- **Congratulations, you've pushed your first commit to GitHub!**
