***So ... Where are the files???!!!***

Depending on the version of CollectionBuilder you're using, there are two ways to generate the site: 
- **GH** users will need to turn on the GitHub Pages option via the settings page of their repository on GitHub.com.

- **CDM** and **SA** users will need to use a Jekyll command. 

Both of these approaches are described below. 

{% include bootstrap/alert.md color="warning" text="**GH users need only consult the [GH: Enabling GitHub Pages](#gh-pages) section below**. 

**CDM and SA users should begin with [CDM & SA: Build the Site](#build) and continue on to the next step**." %}

- [GH: Enabling GitHub Pages](#gh-pages)
- [CDM & SA: Build the Site](#build)
- [CDM & SA: Move the _site Files to Your Web Server](#move)
