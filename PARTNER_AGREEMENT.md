# CollectionBuilder Partner Agreement

**Recognized partners on the CollectionBuilder project shall agree to the following:**

1. The partner institution shall build and deploy a minimum of one collection using a CollectionBuilder tool: CollectionBuilder-skin, CollectionBuilder-GH, or CollectionBuilder-Standalone.
    - The partner’s collection site should include acknowledgement that the site was built by CollectionBuilder and link to the CollectionBuilder project website (https://collectionbuilder.github.io/).

2. By the closing of the grant cycle (August 31, 2020), the partner institution shall provide written feedback on the CollectionBuilder project to the grant team. The grant team will provide partners with more information and guidance closer to the end of the grant cycle.

3. Partners are also invited--but not required--to contribute to the development of CollectionBuilder’s code and community of practice.
    - Code: Partners who wish to contribute to CollectionBuilder’s code should first review the project’s "[How to Contribute to CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)" and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) documents. We welcome contributions that 1) expand the potential use cases of CollectionBuilder, and 2) adhere to our commitment to using code that is transparent and accessible for librarians and information professionals who are not full-time developers.
    
    - Community of practice: Partners can participate in strengthening a community of users around CollectionBuilder by introducing and teaching the tool to others. Community building may occur on a small scale, such as within one’s own library, or on a large scale, such as at professional conferences.

**In return, the CollectionBuilder development team shall commit to the following:**

Recognized partners will be listed on the CollectionBuilder project site, and the grant team may highlight partners’ collections when promoting the tool. Promotion includes, but is not limited to, linking to or featuring collections on the project site and sharing collections in talks or presentations.

In accordance with the project’s [IMLS Planning Grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-34-19-0064-19), the grant team will continue to develop CollectionBuilder and work with with its recognized partners for three years, post award. However, we expect that this project and the community of practice created will continue to grow far into the future. CollectionBuilder’s partners will play an important role in the growth and sustainability of this project by determining the development of the tool and the contexts in which it is used.

CollectionBuilder is one piece in a larger puzzle. Moving forward, we aspire to expand the concepts developed through this project and give librarians and information professionals greater control over the numerous other tools they use across the library ecosystem. Ultimately, we hope our partners and community will share this aspiration and support CollectionBuilder as well as the philosophy and methodology behind it.
