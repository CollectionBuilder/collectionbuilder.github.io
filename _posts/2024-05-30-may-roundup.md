## New CollectionBuilder Add-On

CB Add-Ons can be added to CollectionBuilder-CSV projects to extend their capacity for unique web files and visualizations. The following add-on was recently ... added. (More to come!)

**Online 3D Viewer:** This[ self-contained, o3dv add-on](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/o3dv_cb-add-on) allows you to add interactive 3-D items to CollectionBuilder.[ Online 3D Viewer](https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer) is a library for rendering 3D model files on a web page. You can test your models in their browser-based viewer [3dviewer.net](https://3dviewer.net/). This add-on uses the [o3dv library](https://kovacsv.github.io/Online3DViewer/index.html) to allow embedding an interactive 3d model into pages in your collection project.
