### News:

**Building Oral History Projects:** We recently hosted a CollectionBuilder Monthly Meetup focused on building oral history projects using CollectionBuilder. During the meetup, many helpful strategies, resources, and examples were shared related to integrating oral histories into CollectionBuilder projects. This [blog post](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/2024-01-29-oral-history-projects/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} highlights these resources, methods, and project examples to help guide you as you begin or continue work on oral history collections.

**CB Project Spotlight:** Read about how Bryan Cottle from Meridian Library District used CollectionBuilder for their historical digital collections in this [Q&A blog post](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/2024-01-31-meridian-library-district/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
