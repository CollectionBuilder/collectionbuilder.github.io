Interested in seeing what you can do with CollectionBuilder? Our new [CollectionBuilder Examples](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} site features over 100 CollectionBuilder projects created by a variety of individuals, organizations, and institutions, including students, libraries, and historical societies. 

This digital collection of CollectionBuilder projects shows the range of use cases for CollectionBuilder and hopefully will serve as inspiration for new project ideas. The site was built using the [CollectionBuilder-CSV template](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/csv/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and demonstrates how CollectionBuilder can be used to create a "collection of collections." 

In the CollectionBuilder Examples site, you will find a wide range of project types, including:

- [Digital archives](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/browse.html#digital%20archive){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Student projects](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/browse.html#Student%20Project){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Digital scholarship projects](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/browse.html#Digital%20Scholarship%20Project){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Oral histories](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/browse.html#Oral%20Histories){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- And more!

This is a living digital collection that is continuously being updated. If you have a CollectionBuilder project that you would like to feature on this site, please click on the button below to fill out a brief form.
