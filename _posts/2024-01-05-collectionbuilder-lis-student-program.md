We are excited to announce the Library and Information Science (LIS) students who were selected to participate in the CollectionBuilder LIS Student Program which will run from mid-January to early May 2024. We had an incredible application pool of 90 applicants and it was inspiring to see so many strong applications and creative ideas for CollectionBuilder projects.

The ten selected student participants will be awarded a stipend of $400 to participate in a cohort where they will learn how to use CollectionBuilder and gain foundational web development skills. As part of the program, students will collaborate in groups to:

- Attend 3-5 virtual training sessions with the CollectionBuilder team in a cohort environment. 
- Use [CollectionBuilder's Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and follow tutorials to set up their sites, and then work together to implement and document customization ideas.
- Prepare and publish one short video tutorial documenting a CollectionBuilder feature, or a blog post that highlights their project and experience in the cohort.
- Submit feedback and attend a follow-up virtual meeting with the CollectionBuilder team to discuss their experience.

Below are the 10 members of the student cohort -- congratulations again to all!
