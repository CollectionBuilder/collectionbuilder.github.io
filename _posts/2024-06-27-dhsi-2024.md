During the week of June 11, Olivia, Evan, and myself taught a week-long workshop at the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)](https://dhsi.org/on-campus-courses2024/) at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. The class was titled “Creating Digital Collections with Minimal Infrastructure: Hands On with CollectionBuilder for Teaching and Exhibits” and it focused on building the skill necessary for our students to build CollectionBuilder sites of their own.

Our class of faculty, librarians, and grad students learned all about the CollectionBuilder approach, including GitHub, CSVs, HTML, Jekyll, and more.

This is the second year we've taught the class. You can check out some of the projects created at <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/dhsi2024-share/>, and you can see last year’s projects at <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/dhsi2023-share/>.

We had a great time teaching, and being in Victoria. DHSI is moving to Montreal next year, and we're excited for that new chapter. We will, however, greatly miss spending time in Victoria. The campus and city are beautiful.
