## **This month’s news:**

* **LIS Student Program – Round 2\!** We’re thrilled to announce that applications for our second round of the LIS Student Program are now open\! This initiative provides hands-on opportunities for students interested in CollectionBuilder and digital library work, and we can’t wait to work with our new cohort. Applications are open until **December 1**, so if you know any students who might be interested, please send them our way. They can apply here: [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/community/student-incentives.html](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/community/student-incentives.html).  
    
* **New Digital Librarian Cohort in Development** \- We’re also in the early stages of designing a new Digital Librarian Cohort Program\! This program is targeted toward librarians who want to deepen their digital skills and engage with our tools and practices. We welcome any thoughts, ideas, or suggestions—please send them our way at [collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com](mailto:collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com). We’re aiming to launch in **late November or early December**, with the program running well into 2025\.  
    
* **Upcoming CB Team Retreat**: Next week, the CB Team will be heading out on a retreat\! This time away will give us a chance to dig into some long-awaited updates and new features. Our main goals include:  
* Introducing a glossary page for key terms,  
* Enhancing our “About” page,  
* Improving on our oral history integrations, and  
* Expanding our accessibility messaging and code practices.


We’re excited to just work on CollectionBuilder nonstop for a bit. It’s not as easy for us as it once was\!

## **New Collections:**
