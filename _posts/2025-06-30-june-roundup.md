Hi Everyone, 

June starts the academic summer months, that idyllic time of year when you imagine there will be so much time to complete the million things that have been lingering on the back of your todo list, but somehow it always goes too fast and your todo list just gets bigger!

My suggestion is to sit back in the hammock with a good digital exhibit in hand, and let that todo list simmer... 
If you need some reading material and projects to explore while you relax, take a look at the links in the news section below!

Happy summer, 

\- The CollectionBuilder Team
