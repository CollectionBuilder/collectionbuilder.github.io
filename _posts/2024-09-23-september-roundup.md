**CollectionBuilder Bulletin: September 2024**  
*A monthly round-up of CB news and updates, upcoming events, etc.*  
---

We are back at it this semester, and will be hosting a new monthly meetup this week (see below for details)\! Apologies for the long pause in these updates. If you have a project and/or event you’d like us to highlight next month please email collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com. 

\- The CollectionBuilder Team

**This month's news:**

* **3-D Possibilities in CollectionBuilder:** CB Technical Wizard Evan Williamson recently wrote [a new blog post that details his work modifying CollectionBuilder to include 3d Model Viewers](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/2024-09-05-o3dv/) for the U of I Library's new Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Technology Collection, which was funded by CLIR's "Digitizing Hidden Collections" grant. Evan goes into all the details about his process and includes a link to the source code for others to use.   
  * Evan has made this available as an [Online 3D Viewer Add On](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/o3dv_cb-add-on) so others can use it. These “cb-add-on” repositories are packages of libraries, includes, and layouts to add new features into CB-CSV–download the code and drop it into your CB-CSV project\!  
* Speaking of add-ons, [CB-OralHistory](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/cb-oralhistory) has had some major under-the- hoodupdates over the summer. The accessibility and functionality of the transcripts are all quite improved\!   
* **Grant Budget Revisions:** When former CB Community Liaison Julia found herself a great job at Portland State, the CB Team was left with some of the salary money that was meant to fund her position available on their IMLS grant. Over the summer, the team has worked to revise the grant budget to move those funds into expanding the incentive programs and providing us some more funds to travel. The revised budget was approved by IMLS this past week, and we will be revealing some of the new programs and opportunities very soon. They will include another cohort for MLIS students, and also one for digital librarians wanting to accomplish a project or contribute to CollectionBuilder. More details soon\!

**Upcoming events:**
