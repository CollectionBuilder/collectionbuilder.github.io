Over the years we have had a blast teaching courses at [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](https://dhsi.org/). It is always a unique mix of people (faculty, librarians, and grad students) with amazing project ideas who dive in to learn and build together--such a positive experience!

Excitingly, we have a course again this year, offered in Week 2, June 15 - 19, 2026 at Université de Montréal:

["Creating Digital Collections with Minimal Infrastructure: Hands On With CollectionBuilder for Teaching and Exhibits"](https://dhsi.org/2025/10/01/creating-digital-collections-with-minimal-infrastructure-hands-on-with-collectionbuilder-for-teaching-and-exhibits-dhsi-2026/)

We'll build collections, learn fundamental web skills, and collaborate around digital scholarship.
Check the [CB Examples](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/browse.html#dhsi), our [2025 DHSI Show and Tell collection](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/dhsi2025-share/), or the [past course outline](https://osf.io/t3af7) for some idea of what folks have done.

Montréal is an incredible city full of great food, culture, museums, and walking--so besides digital collections, we will also be enjoying terrific coffee shops and evening strolls!

Join us! And please spread the word to anyone who might be interested.
