### CollectionBuilder Collective Slack

The CollectionBuilder Collective Slack is an interactive space where CollectionBuilder users can converse with one another, ask and respond to questions, share knowledge, collaborate on projects, provide feedback, and stay up to date on CollectionBuilder news. 

This Slack is meant to be a collaborative space for people to discuss their digital projects and learn how to use CollectionBuilder in a supportive environment.

## Community Involvement

There are other ways to get involved as well! If you or your institution might be interested in adopting the CollectionBuilder framework more seriously, we can help. Please get in touch with Julia Stone at [juliastone@uidaho.edu](mailto:juliastone@uidaho.edu) and help us guide the future of CollectionBuilder.

- **Feedback!** - If you have thoughts on the documentation, framework, visualizations, user interactions, or any other features, please *please* **please** provide us with feedback. Our intention in doing workshops and presentations is to gather feedback on the tool so that CollectionBuilder can continue to grow, becoming more useable and useful.
- **Ask Questions** - Get in contact on the [CollectionBuilder GitHub Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/CollectionBuilder/discussions) to ask any technical questions or bring up issues you encounter.
- **Contribute** - If you take to the static web development model and would like to provide contributions of your own to our tool, we would LOVE to work with you and incorporate any contributions you might make. We have a [project code of conduct](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder.github.io/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc with tips and conventions.

Our highest hope for this project is to enable a small army of librarians to develop the type of tools and sites that keep the GLAM professionals in control and not subservient to bloated infrastructures and/or third-party contracts. We hope you will feel drawn to help us build that community.
