## Purpose of the CollectionBuilder Google Group

The **CollectionBuilder Google Group** serves as a listserv where CollectionBuilder users can ask and respond to questions, share knowledge and relevant events, and stay up to date on CollectionBuilder news. Additionally, the CollectionBuilder team will send brief monthly newsletter emails to the listserv covering the latest CollectionBuilder features and updates.

We welcome anyone interested in CollectionBuilder, digital collections and exhibits, and/or static web technology to join. No background in CollectionBuilder or specific technical knowledge is required to participate.

## Content Considerations

Postings to this Google Group should relate to CollectionBuilder, or more broadly to digital collections and exhibits, library technology, and/or static web development. 

**Appropriate topics include but are not limited to:** sharing completed CollectionBuilder projects for feedback, asking questions during any stage of project development, seeking project collaborators and/or contributors, spreading the word about professional development opportunities and educational resources, etc.

If you are ever uncertain if content is appropriate to send to the Google Group, please consult with the CollectionBuilder team at [collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com](mailto:collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com) before posting.

## Communication Guidelines 

Here is a helpful list of guidelines to encourage effective communication:
- Please be considerate in the quantity of emails you post to the Google Group. If private communications (i.e., a thank you message) will suffice, please send a private follow-up email.
- When responding to a Google Group post, please do not "reply to all" unless the content is of broad interest.
- This Google Group is not an appropriate place to send mass distribution emails (e.g., email newsletters, digital marketing campaigns, etc.).
- Please do not send administrative messages such as "Remove me from this email list" through the Google Group. 
- For further assistance on how to use Google Groups, please visit the [Google Groups Help website](https://support.google.com/groups/?hl=en#topic=9216){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
