- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Unacceptable Behavior

CollectionBuilder community spaces will not tolerate harassment and/or unacceptable behavior of any kind. The following behaviors are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person
Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material
- Publishing or threatening to publish others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address or other personally identifiable information, without explicit permission ("doxing")
- Public or private harassment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

If you have questions or concerns about these issues please email the CollectionBuilder team at [collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com](mailto:collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com).

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the CollectionBuilder team as soon as possible at [collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com](mailto:collectionbuilder.team@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The CollectionBuilder team is obligated to uphold confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

The admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as possible. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider contacting the admins by email: Evan Peter Williamson ([ewilliamson@uidaho.edu](mailto:ewilliamson@uidaho.edu)), Devin Becker ([dbecker@uidaho.edu](mailto:dbecker@uidaho.edu)), and Olivia Wikle ([omwikle@iastate.edu](mailto:omwikle@iastate.edu)).

This Code of Conduct applies to all CollectionBuilder community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The CollectionBuilder team reserves the right to exclude people from our community spaces based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces.

## Consequences for Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. The CollectionBuilder team maintains the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject messages that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban (temporarily or permanently) any participant for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful without warning.

Every Code of Conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from the community space. In less urgent situations, at least two admins will discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will be considered final.
