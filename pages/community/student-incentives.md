{:.alert .alert-success}

**Eligibility**: Applicants must be full- or part-time students at ALA-accredited Library and Information Science (LIS) programs in the United States who are interested in learning about CollectionBuilder (no experience necessary!)

**Stipend**: Each participant will receive a $400 stipend.

**Application Deadline**: December 1st, 2024. We will inform applicants of our decision the first week of December.

**Description**: Are you a Library and Information Science (LIS) student interested in expanding your digital collection knowledge and/or learning web development skills? CollectionBuilder is an excellent option for creating a free and long lasting digital collection site that you can add to your portfolio, while exploring tools and platforms such as Git, GitHub, Jekyll, Markdown, HTML, and CSS that you are likely to encounter in your future career as a digital librarian. 

We are looking for students who are interested in learning and customizing a CollectionBuilder site. A CollectionBuilder project might be suitable for an **independent study** or **capstone project** at your institution. To view example CollectionBuilder projects, please visit our [CollectionBuilder Examples site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-examples/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Participants will have the opportunity to experiment with creative uses of the CollectionBuilder framework while learning from one another and comparing experiences in a **cohort environment**. This program is meant to be a learning opportunity; therefore, no specific technical knowledge is required to apply. Participants will use CollectionBuilder's robust [documentation]({{ '/cb-docs/' | relative_url }}) and follow tutorials to set up their sites, then work with the CollectionBuilder team and one another to implement and document customization ideas.

**Expectations Include:**

- Participate in virtual discussions with other student incentive recipients and the CollectionBuilder team
- Follow a series of brief tutorials to prepare data and create a CollectionBuilder site
- Prepare and publish a blog post reflecting on your project experience or a short video tutorial documenting a CollectionBuilder feature
- Submit feedback to the CollectionBuilder team to discuss the experience

**Timeline**: Students will create their projects during the Spring 2025 semester.

**Stipends Available**: 8
