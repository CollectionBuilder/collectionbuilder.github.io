**Description**: We're looking for digital librarians broadly construed who have an interest working with a cohort of professionals over the course of 2025 to:

- advance their own understanding of CollectionBuilder and Lib-Static development practices
- build a CollectionBuilder-based project
- contribute back to the CollectionBuiler project and cohort community via feedback, documentation, and/or features 

Participants must have some familiarity with the CollectionBuilder framework, a willingness to learn, and a desire to explore a creative method of using or communicating CollectionBuilder. Examples might include 

- building a custom digital scholarship project
- migrating older digital humanities projects to a CB/static infrastructure
- investigating what it would take to migrate your organizations' digital collections to CollectionBuilder
- using a different models/frameworks to generate CB-based collections

The cohort will meet about once a month for most of the year. The CollectionBuilder team is committed to supporting program participants and working with them to implement their feedback and ideas. 

**Expectations**:
- Meet regularly with the cohort to advance our work and understanding
- Create one CollectionBuilder project 
- Review and/or produce documentation, educational resources, and/or template code for CollectionBuilder

**Timeline**: TBA
