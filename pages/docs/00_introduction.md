CollectionBuilder was built for a wide variety of users, so we've tried to make the tool as easy to use as possible. Some initial set-up is required, especially for our Skin and Stand-Alone versions, as these require the installation of Ruby and Jekyll on a personal computer. 

Once the initial set-up is complete, users will be able to create their collections through adjustments to metadata and to config files. 

### Types

{:.alert .alert-info }
This Documentation applies to all the "Types" of the CollectionBuilder tool. For the majority of the tool's features and setups, the documentation is the same. <br /><br/> When it is different--**GH users**, for instance, can ignore many steps--we indicate that via columns, bolded font, and colored-alerts (like this one). 

The types are currently: 

- **GH** - for [CollectionBuilder-GH](/gh/), our lightweight, GitHub Pages version.

- **CDM** - for [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](/skins/), a skin version that works with the CONTENTdm API.

- **SA** - for CollectionBuilder-Stand-Alone, the full digital library solution we are currently developing.
