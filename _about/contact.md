## Contact & Help

Our [documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) contains detailed walk through information for starting CollectionBuilder projects and our [Tutorials page](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/tutorials.html) provides our latest videos -- *but we want your questions!*

CollectionBuilder is building a learning community, so one of the best ways to get help, and help others in the process, is to ask questions on the [CollectionBuilder Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/CollectionBuilder/discussions).
Always provide a link to your repository as it makes understanding and debugging the issue *much* easier!
